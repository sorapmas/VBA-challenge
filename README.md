## Background:
VBA-Stock-Analysis is a project written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that performs analysis on stock market data generated by the script. This Virtual Basic Scripting file iterates through a year's worth of stock data, extracting and saving relevant values from each row.

## Instructions:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
  - Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:
  - Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
